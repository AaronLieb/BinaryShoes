# Binary Shoes
A project for CPSC 440 - Computer System Architecture

## The Idea

A pair of portable devices that are small enough to fit inside of a shoe.
Each shoe will have a transeiver capable of receiving and sending messages to
another person wearing binary shoes or another device. Each shoe device will
come with a vibrator to communicate the messages incoming messages to the
wearer


## Vibration or Bone Conduction

The vibration could come from anywhere and signal the messages to the user, but
this would require that the user is able to decode the messages real time.

A bone conduction device would allow for audio to be transmitted to the wearer,
but may be harder to discreetly hide

A bone conduction hat, beanie, glasses, or below the neck option would be a good solutions.
